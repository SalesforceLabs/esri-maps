# ESRI Maps Accelerator
The goal of this application is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the license request process by integrating ESRI Maps with Salesforce (SFDC).
Using this application, applicants can easily submit their requests and plot the relevant area on the map using ESRI Libraries. Reviewers can review and make changes to the map before approving or rejecting the request. 
This application is designed for Administrators, Applicants, and Reviewers, with each user having specific permissions and responsibilities within the application. By leveraging ESRI Libraries and SFDC, this application provides a streamlined and user-friendly experience for all parties involved in the permit/license request process.

Documentation of the Accelerator can be found in the TechnicalDesignDocument.docx and Installation instructions can be found in the User_Module.docx

There is also a more basic version of the accelerator provided as an example in the BasicMap folder.
